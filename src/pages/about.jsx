            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm a student studying computer science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
              I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions through technology. 
              Through my internships at Amazon and research in computational biology, 
              I've gained valuable experience applying technical skills to solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I'm comfortable with full-stack development, having worked on projects that involve both frontend and backend technologies.
              I've also developed several LLM-based applications, exploring the potential of AI to create intelligent and responsive systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy hiking, photography, and watching all sports.
            </p>
            
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              My journey in web development began during my college years when I first 
              discovered the power of HTML and CSS. Since then, I've continuously expanded 
              my skills and knowledge, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and 
              technologies in the industry.
            </p>

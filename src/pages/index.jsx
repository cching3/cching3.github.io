                 Hi! I'm a rising junior studying computer science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
                 I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions through technology. 
                 Through my internships at Amazon and research in computational biology, 
                 I've gained valuable experience applying technical skills to solve real-world problems.

              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy hiking, photography, and watching all sports.
